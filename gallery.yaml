  Our project is a two-player battleship game. It supports the standard battleship
  mechanics like ship placement, turn-based attacks, hit/miss/sink detection, and
  sinking and win checking. 

  The interface for each player consists of two 10x10 boards, the upper board
  representing the player's personal board -- holding their 5 ships and all their
  opponents attack attempts -- and the lower board representing the player's attack
  board -- showing the results of their own attack attempts.

  The game logic is fully modular, making it easy to extend with new ship types and
  custom board sizes.
